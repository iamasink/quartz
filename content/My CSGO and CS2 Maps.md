# de_nuke_custom or "i fixed nuke :)"
[GitHub - iamasink/de\_nuke\_custom](https://github.com/iamasink/de_nuke_custom)
My custom nuke map for CS:GO. It was basically (old new) nuke but with many clip brushes removed and doors changed to be openable

i worked on this map with [Bearably ](https://github.com/Bearably), who did most of the work past my initial layout devtexture map

sadly I lost the latest editable version of this map, its possible i have it on a USB somewhere but I doubt it. This version is from April 2019 while the latest was from around October 2019
Maybe one day I'll create a source 2 version from scratch, but I think I'd rather make something new, especially after porting my old nuke map
