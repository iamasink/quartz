quartz is kinda cool. i probably wouldn't have used it if i didn't already know how to use obsidian, but I don't even use obsidian that much!! but it is a nice editor and markdown is cool (except it's weird line breaking stuff but that can be fixed here :3)
and like I would be way too lazy to do anything of the sorts otherwise.
